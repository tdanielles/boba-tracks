## Purpose
With so many different flavours and toppings, its hard to resist a refreshing cup of bubble tea, but we often overlook the amount of calories in the drink. Since almost every boba store allows customers to customize their drinks, adding toppings and extra sugar could easily cause the calories to stack up. So while we get a refreshing treat, we also stay oblivious to its negative impact on our health.

Therefore, we created Boba Tracks, a calorie tracker that lets a consumer know if their drink is over the average amount of calories in a bubble tea drink.
